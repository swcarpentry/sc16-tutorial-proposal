# Detailed description of the proposed tutorial

This tutorial would primarily be of interest to training staff,
to develop or improve their in-person workshops for novice
High Performance Computing (HPC) users
who do not have programming experience.
The goal of the workshop is to help local administrators
teach the basic lab skills of research computing in HPC
to their new users.
The material and teaching practices are based on the
Bash and Python lessons from Software Carpentry,
which have taught users essential scientific computing skills
at hundreds of workshops.
The Software Carpentry lesson style consists of
short 10-15 minute sessions of instruction,
followed by hands on interactive exercises,
and the occasional "challenge" exercise.
Experiencing this HPC tutorial as a student learner,
delivered by Software Carpentry instructors,
would help prepare potential instructors
to return to their institutions and practise well tested teaching methods
and re-use and modify the lesson material.

The full-day tutorial will consist of 2 parts:

1. Basics of interacting with the cluster:

  - Essential terminology and structure of the cluster

  - Logging in and becoming familiar with the filesystem layout

  - Transfering files to and from the cluster

  - Use software with environment modules

  - Submitting batch jobs from the commandline

  - Submitting batch job scripts

  - Querying job status

2. Workflow and parallel computing practices

  - Review of parallel programming concepts

  - "Embarrassingly" parallel workflow, several input files

  - "Real" parallel workflow with MPI enabled program

  - Develop workflows starting from serial programs

  - Effectively reporting errors with jobs

  - Analyzing performance issues

The audience will be expected to bring a bring a laptop computer
with wireless or wired internet for cluster SSH access.

Unlike the "Parallel Computing 101" tutorial that has been offered
at Supercomputing for the past few years,
this tutorial is directed at outreach;
of bringing inexperienced users into the HPC community.
The scope of the workflow is intentionally limited to focus on
foundational concepts and respond to common interests of new users.

The "Best Practices for HPC Training" tutorial,
where trainers are invited to present their teaching experience,
is an excellent complementary tutorial.
Our hope is our proposed tutorial would not overlap on the schedule
to allow conference attendees to visit both tutorials.
